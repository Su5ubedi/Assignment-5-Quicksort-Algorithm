# Assignment 5 Quicksort Algorithm
 
In this analysis, the goal is to compare the performance of randomized and deterministic approaches to quicksort algorithm implementation. The results indicate that deterministic Quicksort performs better when the data is randomly distributed, while randomized Quicksort performs better in terms of reducing the risks of facing the worst-case complexity. When dealing with a large data set, it is better to use randomized Quicksort, considering that it has faster execution time.
We can run the script by just executing it directly without any modification.
